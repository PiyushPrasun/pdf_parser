selves in several identified fields of application. One benefit is that AI has
"the capacity to process millions of items of up-to-date data, thus generat-"
"ing gains in completeness, timeliness and the development of several pos-"
sible hypotheses for disease detection. The physician will then have better
access to the information necessary for his decision-making including a
complete histology of the patient providing access to the best therapeutic
protocols based on evidence-based medicine.
If such “intelligent” expert systems gain the confidence of physicians and
"the general public, the impact on the physician’s profession can be multi-"
faceted. Physicians will be able to benefit from assistance in the manage-
"ment of complex case diagnoses, with greater security in decision-making."
It will also lead to a strengthening of the doctor-patient relationship and
dialogue in order to provide the information necessary to understand the
diagnoses. The use of artificial intelligence will continuously increase the
level of “technical” competence of the physician as he or she is able to fully
exploit the most up-to-date clinical knowledge and medical practices. This
"could result in a cognitive enrichment of the physician’s work, with less"
time spent interpreting “routine” data that intelligent systems can han-
dle leaving the most complex expert cases to the physician. An increase in
skills will be all the more necessary as the doctor will also need to be able
to “challenge” the software and to explain the diagnosis and therapeutic
management responsibly.
"These advantages, if they were to become widespread in the daily prac-"
"tice of physicians, would make it possible to combine human intelligence"
and artificial intelligence in a complementary way in the service of better
"decision-making, combining speed of decision-making and better optimi-"
zation of patient care expenses. This is also the case in the field of surgery
"with Star (for Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot), a robot that does not com-"
pletely replace specialized surgeons but provides them with a tool capa-
